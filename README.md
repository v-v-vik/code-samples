# Code Style Showcase

This small repository contains two handpicked backend files that demonstrate my coding style, structure, and attention to clean, maintainable code. These examples are written in **TypeScript** using **NestJS**, and they reflect how I approach real-world backend logic with a focus on modularity and readability.

## Included Files

- `authorize-via-oauth.usecase.ts`  
  ➤ A use case handler for authorizing users via OAuth. Focuses on clean separation of concerns and dependency injection.

- `oauth-provider-factory.service.ts`  
  ➤ A factory service that dynamically resolves the correct OAuth provider implementation, showcasing use of strategy pattern.

## Purpose

This repository is not a full project, but rather a **snapshot of how I write code** in professional settings. It aims to highlight:

- Thoughtful file structure
- Clear naming conventions
- Use of SOLID principles/CQRS, Strategy pattern
- Practical backend patterns
